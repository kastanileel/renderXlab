# renderXlab
A lightweight WebGPU framework for modern path tracing algorithms and rendering research in the browser. Includes an example library of implemented papers and interactive demos.

# motivation:
I love prototyping PBR research and papers in Shadertoy. However, working only with fragment shaders feels a bit limiting. I also donâ€™t like relying on a third party to host my shaders or store them.

## Todo v0.9:
- [ ] core handling webgpu stuff
- [ ] api for easy use
- [ ] simple ui library for interactions
- [ ] obj parser (only meshes)
- [ ] shape -> material mapping
- [ ] example using the framework and implementing mis from e. veach
